• Towing Manager is the website, which provides information about Towed vehicles 
to Owners.
• The main aim is to text a message to the owner of the vehicle when his vehicle
is Towed. The message contains the owner's vehicle number, Place where the vehicle
is taken after towing.
• The towing manager shows the parking area to people near them.
• In addition to it states how much fine the owner has to pay and an online payment
gateway to pay penalty online and offline too. Via payment modes, we can decrease
corruption in the system.
• Towing Manager has a unique feature like Roadside assistant to help people when
 their vehicle breaks down or battery failure.
